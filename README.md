# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple project about tracking our tasks. It includes the simple UI as well as JSON-server for my mock backend.

## Usage

Shortcut for testing app ->

After you cloned the project, open the folder "Task-Tracker-React" and if you are using VS Code, use Git Bash Here and type "code ." to open the Visual Studio code with all project files so you can test the app.

After that, open Terminal and use the command below for installing workspace npm dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After the installation of all required npm dependency packages, in the same Terminal type command below for starting JSON-server:

```
npm run server
```

After that, open the new Terminal and type the command below for starting the app: 

```
npm start
```
